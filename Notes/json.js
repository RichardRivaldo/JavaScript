/* JSON */

// A JSON is basically JS objects, can also be array of objects
// The JS then can communicate with other languages by trading objects

/* Fetch */

// Fetch can be used to get data from APIs and mostly it returns us a JSON object
// fetch(fetchedAPI)
// Fetch is a promise, and we can use .then() to use callbacks after the fetching is done

// We can convert the JSON object to JS Object with .json()
// The method is also a promise
