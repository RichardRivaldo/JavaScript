/* Async and Await */

// Async and Await are syntactic sugar of promises
// Because of these two functionalities, the code will be a lot cleaner and looks totally like sync codes
// The background process is the same as promises

// To declare an async function, use `async function functionName()`
// To call async functions, use `await functions()`

/* Error Handling */

// Wrap the async callers in a try-catch block
// The catch will catch the errors thrown by the function
